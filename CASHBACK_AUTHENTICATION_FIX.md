# Cashback Authentication & Sync Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Authentication 401 Errors** (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** Cashback API calls were failing with 401 unauthorized errors
**Root Cause:** cashbackService was using wrong token key (`token` instead of `eco_swift_token`)

**Solution:**
- Updated `src/services/cashbackService.ts` to use proper axios instance with interceptors
- Changed from creating new axios instance each time to a singleton `cashbackAPI`
- Now uses `eco_swift_token` from localStorage (same as other services)
- Added request/response interceptors for:
  - Automatic token inclusion in headers
  - Token refresh on API responses  
  - Proper error handling without auto-redirect

### 2. ✅ **Order Deletion Sync**
**Problem:** When WooCommerce orders were deleted, cashback entries remained, causing "Order not found" errors

**Solution:**
Added two WordPress hooks in `class-admin.php`:
```php
add_action('before_delete_post', [$this, 'delete_cashback_on_order_delete']);
add_action('woocommerce_delete_order', [$this, 'delete_cashback_on_wc_order_delete']);
```

Now when an order is deleted:
1. ✅ Associated cashback entries are automatically deleted from database
2. ✅ If cashback was already approved, amount is deducted from user's wallet
3. ✅ No orphan cashback records
4. ✅ No "order not found" errors

### 3. ✅ **Removed "Reject" Option - Changed to "Delete"**
**Problem:** Admin had confusing "Approve/Reject" options

**Solution:**
Changed to simpler "Approve/Delete" workflow:

**Admin Panel Actions:**
- ✅ **Approve** - Approves and credits cashback to wallet
- ✅ **Delete** - Permanently deletes cashback entry (and deducts from wallet if already approved)
- ❌ **Reject** - REMOVED (was confusing and unnecessary)

**Benefits:**
- Simpler admin workflow
- Clear actions: either approve or remove completely
- No confusion about "rejected" vs "deleted" status
- Admins can delete approved cashbacks if needed (automatically deducts from wallet)

### 4. ✅ **Wallet Sync**
**Ensure:** All approved cashbacks now properly sync with wallet menu

**Features:**
- Real-time wallet balance updates
- Accurate transaction history
- Proper balance calculations
- Delete operation properly deducts from wallet

## Files Modified

   - Delete method properly deducts from wallet if cashback was approved

4. **`embolo-cashback-system/assets/js/admin.js`**

## Technical Details

### Authentication Flow (BEFORE - Broken)
```javascript
// OLD - Wrong token key
const createApiClient = () => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('token'); // ❌ WRONG!
  return axios.create({
    baseURL: API_BASE_URL,
    headers: {
      'Authorization': token ? `Bearer ${token}` : '',
    },
  });
};
```

### Authentication Flow (AFTER - Fixed)
```javascript
// NEW - Correct token with interceptors
const cashbackAPI = axios.create({
  baseURL: API_BASE_URL,
  timeout: 15000,
});

cashbackAPI.interceptors.request.use((config) => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('eco_swift_token'); // ✅ CORRECT!
  if (token) {
    config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  }
  return config;
});

cashbackAPI.interceptors.response.use((response) => {
  // Auto token refresh
  const newToken = response.headers['x-jwt-token'];
  if (newToken) {
    localStorage.setItem('eco_swift_token', newToken);
  }
  return response;
});
```

### Order Deletion Sync Flow
```
WooCommerce Order Deleted
         ↓
WordPress Hook Triggered
         ↓
delete_cashback_on_order_delete()
         ↓
Get Associated Cashback Entries
         ↓
For each cashback:
  ├─ If status = 'completed'
  │    └─ Deduct amount from wallet
  └─ Delete cashback entry from DB
         ↓
✅ Clean Database
✅ Accurate Wallet Balance
```

### Delete vs Reject

**OLD Workflow (Confusing):**
- Approve → Credits wallet, status = 'completed'
- Reject → Changes status to 'rejected', entry stays in DB
- Problem: What's difference between rejected and deleted?

**NEW Workflow (Simple):**
- ✅ Approve → Credits wallet, status = 'completed'
- ✅ Delete → Removes entry completely, deducts from wallet if needed
- Clear and straightforward!
