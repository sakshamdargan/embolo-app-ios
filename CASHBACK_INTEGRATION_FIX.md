# Cashback System Integration Fix

## Problem Summary
The cashback popup was showing "Network Error" and cashback wasn't being recorded in the wallet.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Missing Integration Hook** ❌
- The orders controller wasn't firing the `eco_swift_order_created` action
- The cashback system was listening for this hook but never received it
- Result: Backend cashback was never created automatically

### 2. **Frontend Trying to Create Cashback** ❌
- The popup was calling `/cashback/process` API to CREATE cashback
- This caused Network Error due to timing/authentication issues
- The frontend should FETCH existing cashback, not create it

### 3. **JWT Token Expiration** ❌
- JWT tokens were expiring in 120 seconds (2 minutes)
- By the time popup tried to call API, token was expired
- Fixed to 30-day expiration

### 4. **Sliding Session Conflicts** ❌
- Sliding session logic was causing token extension issues
- Removed all sliding session code from both backend and frontend

---

## Fixes Applied

### ✅ Fix 1: Added Integration Hook to Orders Controller
**File**: `/eco-swift-chemist-api/includes/class-chemist-orders-controller.php`

```php
// Trigger cashback system integration
do_action('eco_swift_order_created', $order->get_id(), [
    'order' => $order,
    'user_id' => $user->ID,
    'order_total' => $order->get_total()
]);
```

**What this does:**
- When an order is created, fires the `eco_swift_order_created` action
- The cashback system's `Hooks` class listens for this action
- Automatically creates cashback entry in database
- No frontend API call needed!

---

### ✅ Fix 2: Changed Popup from CREATE to FETCH
**File**: `/src/components/cashback/CashbackPopup.tsx`

**Before (Broken):**
```typescript
const result = await processCashback(orderId, orderValue);
// This tried to CREATE cashback → Network Error
```

**After (Fixed):**
```typescript
// Wait for backend to create cashback via hook
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1500));

// FETCH the already-created cashback
const result = await getOrderCashback(orderId);
```

**What this does:**
- Waits 1.5 seconds for backend to create cashback via the hook
- Then fetches the existing cashback from database
- Shows it in the popup with animation

---

### ✅ Fix 3: Fixed JWT Token Expiration
**File**: `/eco-swift-chemist-api/includes/class-settings.php`

```php
public static function get_jwt_expire() {
    // Fixed 30-day JWT token validity - no sliding session
    return 30 * DAY_IN_SECONDS; // 30 days
}
```

**What this does:**
- JWT tokens now valid for 30 days instead of 2 minutes
- Users stay authenticated for 30 days
- No more expired token errors

---

### ✅ Fix 4: Removed Sliding Session Logic
**Files Modified:**
1. `/embolo-cashback-system/includes/class-cashback-controller.php`
2. `/eco-swift-chemist-api/eco-swift-chemist-api.php`
3. `/src/services/cashbackService.ts`

**What was removed:**
- Backend token extension on every API call
- Frontend token update interceptors
- Global token storage variables

**Result:**
- Clean, simple authentication flow
- No token conflicts or race conditions
- Fixed 30-day token validity

## How It Works Now

### Order Creation Flow:
```
1. User places order
   ↓
2. Orders controller creates WooCommerce order
   ↓
3. Orders controller fires: do_action('eco_swift_order_created', ...)
   ↓
4. Cashback Hooks class receives the action
   ↓
5. Cashback is calculated and saved to database
   ↓
6. Frontend displays success
   ↓
7. Cashback popup waits 1.5s then fetches cashback
   ↓
8. Popup shows cashback amount with confetti! 🎉
```

### Database Tables Updated:
- `wp_embolo_cashback` - Cashback entry created
- `wp_embolo_wallets` - User wallet updated
- `wp_embolo_user_streaks` - Streak data updated

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Before Deploying:
- [ ] Upload all modified PHP files to server
- [ ] Build frontend: `npm run build`
- [ ] Deploy built frontend

### ✅ After Deploying:
1. [ ] **Log out and log back in** to get fresh 30-day JWT token
2. [ ] Place a test order
3. [ ] Check if cashback popup shows (wait ~3 seconds)
4. [ ] Verify cashback amount appears in popup
5. [ ] Check wallet page - cashback should be visible
6. [ ] Check WordPress admin - cashback entry should exist

### ✅ Database Verification:
```sql
-- Check if cashback was created
SELECT * FROM wp_embolo_cashback WHERE order_id = [YOUR_ORDER_ID];

-- Check wallet balance
SELECT * FROM wp_embolo_wallets WHERE user_id = [YOUR_USER_ID];

-- Check streak data
SELECT * FROM wp_embolo_user_streaks WHERE user_id = [YOUR_USER_ID];
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Popup shows error state
**Solution:** 
- Check if user is logged in with fresh token
- Check server error logs for backend issues
- Verify plugin is activated

### Issue: Cashback not in wallet
**Solution:**
- Check database for cashback entry
- Verify order status is "processing"
- Check if cashback system is enabled in settings

### Issue: Still getting Network Error
**Solution:**
- Clear browser cache
- Log out and log back in (get fresh JWT token)
- Check if backend files are deployed
- Verify plugin is activated on server

---

## Important Notes

1. **Re-login Required:** After deploying the JWT expiration fix, users must log out and log back in to get a fresh 30-day token.

2. **Automatic Processing:** Cashback is now created automatically by the backend. The frontend only fetches and displays it.

3. **No Manual API Calls:** Frontend should never call `/cashback/process` directly. It's handled by the backend hook.

4. **Approval Required:** Cashback starts in "processing" status. Admin must approve it in WordPress admin before it's added to wallet balance.

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Upload Backend Files
Upload these files to your WordPress server:
```
eco-swift-chemist-api/includes/class-chemist-orders-controller.php
eco-swift-chemist-api/includes/class-settings.php
eco-swift-chemist-api/eco-swift-chemist-api.php
embolo-cashback-system/includes/class-cashback-controller.php
```

### Step 2: Build and Deploy Frontend
```bash
npm run build
# Then upload the dist/ folder to your hosting
```

### Step 3: Test
1. Log out from the app
2. Log back in (gets fresh 30-day token)
3. Place a test order
4. Watch the cashback popup magic! ✨
